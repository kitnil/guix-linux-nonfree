;;; Forgive me Stallman for I have sinned.

;;;Some notes since this took a little bit to figure out
;;;Use this function to grab what firmware you need
;;;This is setup to clone the firmware repo as it was on 
;;;April 14th 2017

;;;If you want to update go to kernel.org and find the current commit 
;;;it'll be a long string like below, and then change it here
;;;it'll fail when it runs your next guix commmand asking for this package
;;;and will give you the new sha256sum needed which you simply put below
